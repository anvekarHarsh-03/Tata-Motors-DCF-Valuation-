# Tata Motors – DCF Valuation (May 2025)
This project performs a full discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation of Tata Motors Ltd. using a structured, bottom-up forecasting model. The analysis forecasts sales, EBITDA, FCFF, and intrinsic value per share under base-case operating assumptions.

The valuation incorporates reinvestment analysis, ROIC profiling, long-term cash flow modeling, and a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) computed via peer comparables. All computations are supported by PDF outputs for DCF valuation and WACC build-up.

# Project Objective
To estimate the intrinsic value of **Tata Motors Ltd.** as of May 2025 using a DCF methodology and determine whether the company is overvalued or undervalued relative to its current market price.

# Key Valuation Findings
### Intrinsic Value Estimate — Base Case  
* Enterprise Value (EV): ₹317,238.0 Cr  
* Equity Value: ₹286,532.0 Cr  
* Intrinsic Value per Share: **₹778.5**  
* Current Stock Price (30 May 2025): ₹715  
* **Implied Undervaluation: 8.88%**

The model indicates that **Tata Motors is modestly undervalued**, with intrinsic value slightly above the prevailing market price.

# Modeling Framework

## 1. Revenue, EBITDA & EPS Forecasts
Forecasts are derived from historical performance and scenario-based adjustments.

### Sales Forecasting (2016–2032E)
* Revenue grows from ₹273,045 Cr (2016A) to ₹514,794 Cr (2032E).  
* Long-term growth normalizes to 3–4% by 2032E.

### EBITDA Forecasting (2016–2032E)
* EBITDA grows from ₹38,395 Cr (2016A) to ~₹59,855 Cr (2032E).  
* Recovery supported by scale efficiencies and margin expansion.

### EPS Forecasting (2016–2032E)
* EPS grows from ₹47.7 (2016A) to ₹29.3 (2032E).  
* Early-year volatility reflects restructuring cycles, followed by stabilization.

## 2. Reinvestment & ROIC Analysis
Reinvestment rate and returns on invested capital were evaluated using historical data.

### Historical ROIC (10-year range)
* ROIC fluctuates heavily due to business cycles but stabilizes around mid-teens in recent years.

### Reinvestment Rate
* Highly volatile due to cyclical capex and working capital swings.  
* Recent years show normalized reinvestment improving profitability.

## 3. Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)
Formula: **FCFF = NOPAT + Depreciation − Capex − ΔWorking Capital**

### Base-Case FCFF Forecast (2026–2030E)
Because the older FCFF years (2021–2025) are historical/transition years, the model uses the projected period 2026–2030 for valuation:

* 2026E: ₹21,124.3 Cr  
* 2027E: ₹25,913.3 Cr  
* 2028E: ₹29,132.5 Cr  
* 2029E: ₹33,421.6 Cr  
* 2030E: ₹36,089.5 Cr  

### Terminal Value (TV)
* Terminal growth rate (g): 2%  
* TV: ₹375,242.1 Cr  
* PV of TV: ₹214,737.5 Cr  

### Sum of PVs
* PV of FCFF (2026E–2030E): ₹102,500.6 Cr

## 4. WACC Calculation
Key Inputs:
* Cost of Equity: 12.59%  
* Post-Tax Cost of Debt: 4.88%  
* Equity Weight: 89.85%  
* Debt Weight: 10.15%  
* **WACC: 11.81%**

Tata Motors’ higher beta (1.18) and cyclical risk profile result in a materially higher WACC than consumer-staple peers.

# Sensitivity Analysis
Valuation is sensitive to:
* WACC corresponding to industry cyclicality  
* Terminal growth rate (TGR)  
* Capex discipline and operating margins  

Minor improvements in WACC or FCFF growth meaningfully increase intrinsic value due to high dependence on terminal value.

# Conclusion
The May 2025 DCF valuation suggests that **Tata Motors is slightly undervalued**, with intrinsic value above market price. Value drivers include:

* Strong FCFF growth trajectory  
* Operational recovery  
* Improving ROIC and reinvestment efficiency  

This project demonstrates:
* End-to-end valuation modeling  
* Multi-scenario forecasting  
* Peer-derived WACC computation  
* FCFF and terminal value modeling  
* Sensitivity-driven investment insights
